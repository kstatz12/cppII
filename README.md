[link](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/enable-virtualization-on-windows-c5578302-6e43-4b4b-a449-8ced115f58e1)

This will allow you to run different operating systems, virtually, on top of your windows install

### Install Vagrant
[vagrant install docs](https://developer.hashicorp.com/vagrant/docs/installation)

install vagrant from hashicorp. this will allow you to spin up the pre-defined virtual machine i have provided


#### Optional
- virtualbox
this is a virtualization platform that helps smooth out virtualizing operating systems


# bringing up virtual machine
in the root directory of the project, in your favorite shell (please dont use CMD, powershell or windows terminal)
run:

``` shell
vagrant up
```
this command might time out. if it does, just re-run it and it should continue where it left off
